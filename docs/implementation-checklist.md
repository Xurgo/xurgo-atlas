# Xurgo Atlas — Implementation Checklist

> Last updated: 2026-06-22 (current-state alignment for Atlas release-baseline work)
> Status: **The live repository is an Atlas-branded `xurgo-atlas` v0.2.1 baseline; current priority is to preserve that baseline, while older private-RC and naming-migration checkpoints remain below as historical implementation record**
>
> Current state:
> - Product name and package metadata now point to **Xurgo Atlas** / `xurgo-atlas`.
> - Current delivery priority is to keep a credible Atlas release baseline intact with accurate governed docs, stable CLI/MCP behavior, and recent read-only diagnostic/provenance surfaces.
> - Historical references to `docu-guard` or older milestone plans are preserved below when they describe the implementation history at the time rather than the current headline.

## Current Release Baseline

| Area | Current state | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Product identity | ✅ Current | User-facing product name is **Xurgo Atlas**; package metadata is `xurgo-atlas` |
| Package baseline | ✅ Current | `package.json` reports version `0.2.1`; verify the exact live checkout identity from Git instead of freezing a SHA in this checklist |
| Release posture | ✅ Current | Focus is preserving a credible baseline first, not reopening the June private RC checkpoint as the standing current focus |
| Recent baseline-preserving additions | ✅ Current | Read-only `doctor`, managed-state/provenance reporting, internal client conformance checks, and `docs.search` are already landed on `main` |
| Historical checkpoints | ℹ️ Historical | Private RC readiness, storage migration readiness, and naming-migration planning remain useful record but are not the primary current work queue |

## Known Gaps / Post-MVP

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| `commit/{revision}/{path}` resource URI | Low | Listed in PRD example URIs but not in Required MVP Resources |
| `search.ts` module | Low | Post-MVP search entry point for Atlas-managed docs/context; SQLite FTS first, optional sqlite-vec later, no Qdrant/default external vector service |
| Web review UI | Post-MVP | Future enhancement |
| Cloud sync / team approvals | Post-MVP | Future enhancement |
| GitHub PR integration | Post-MVP | Future enhancement |
| VS Code extension | Post-MVP | Future enhancement |
| File watcher for direct writes | Post-MVP | Future enhancement |
| Multi-file patches | Post-MVP | Currently single-file only |
| Semantic merge resolution | Post-MVP | Explicitly non-goal for MVP |
| CI/pre-commit integration | Post-MVP | Secondary goal |
| Historical full-text search | ✅ Complete | Local lexical FTS search implemented as `docs.search`; semantic/vector retrieval remains future work |
| Agent activity dashboard | Post-MVP | Future enhancement |
| Managed branch promotion / merge (`docs.merge_branch`) | Unimplemented | Policy defines `branching.merge_to_main_requires` but no tool or workflow exists. De facto sync model: feature branch → `docs.export` → working tree → `git add/commit` → source repo. Does not block v0.4 — STATUS.md and manifest can be edited directly on `main` via `propose_patch` → `commit_patch`, or synced via export from feature branches. |
| `better-sqlite3` vs `node:sqlite` | ✅ Resolved | Using built-in `node:sqlite` (Node 22+) — intentional improvement |

## v0.3 — Storage Model Audit & Implementation

> **Status:** Configurable managed storage implemented (commit `2979ee2`); external dogfooding complete
> **Spec:** [`docs/spec/docu-guard-mcp-v0.3-storage-model.md`](./spec/docu-guard-mcp-v0.3-storage-model.md)

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Storage model audit completed | ✅ Complete | Evaluated project-local, global-only, and managed-with-configurable-dirs models |
| Recommended model chosen | ✅ Complete | Managed storage with configurable `--config-dir` and `--data-dir`; project-local mode removed |
| Registry schema v2 designed | ✅ Complete | `configDir` and `dataDir` at top level; no `storeType` field |
| `--config-dir` / `--data-dir` flags for daemon | ✅ Complete | Replaces `--store` flag; separates config from data |
| Path resolution using configurable dirs | ✅ Complete | `<dataDir>/projects/<projectId>/` for managed state |
| Project-local `.docu-guard/` removal | ✅ Complete | `init` no longer creates `.docu-guard/`; no auto-detection or fallback |
| Existing `.docu-guard/` migration helper | ⏳ Pending | One-time copy from `.docu-guard/` to `<dataDir>/projects/<id>/` |
| Registry backward compatibility | ✅ Complete | v1 loaded and upgraded silently; saved as v2 |
| External dogfooding (disposable project) | ✅ Complete | Init + registry + daemon + full MCP patch workflow + export verified; no `.docu-guard/` created |
| Daemon path validation | ⏳ Pending | Validate configDir/dataDir existence at startup (currently prints paths but does not validate) |
| Desktop/VPS/Docker path defaults | ⏳ Pending | Defaults use XDG conventions; `/etc`/`/var/lib` defaults not auto-detected |
| Self-dogfood on docu-guard-mcp itself | ✅ Complete | Self-dogfood validated: init + daemon + full MCP patch cycle on this repo |
| Tests for new storage model | ✅ Complete | 22 registry tests (v2 schema, v1 compat, CRUD, resolution), 4 daemon tests, 9 HTTP server tests, tilde expansion, CLI init registration |

### Known Follow-Up Items

| Issue | Priority | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| GitStore `withWorkDir` should reset/clean workdir before each operation | ✅ Complete | `git reset --hard HEAD && git clean -fd` added at start of every `withWorkDir` call; regression test added (`GitStore workdir cleanup`). Fix in `src/core/git-store.ts` line 146-151 |
| Initial long-patch failure with `git apply` "corrupt patch" | Low | A patch with a `Date:` field line was rejected as corrupt by git; shorter simpler patch applied cleanly. Pre-existing patch-format fragility, not storage-model specific |
| Self-dogfood on docu-guard-mcp itself | Medium | Completed end-to-end (init → daemon → create_branch → propose_patch → preview_diff → commit_patch → history → export). Branch promoted to source repo via export + manual git commit. Managed `main` does not yet contain feature branch commits — see "Managed branch promotion" gap in Known Gaps above. |

## Historical Naming Migration Planning (Post-v0.4)

> **Status:** Historical planning record; implementation not started in this checklist.
> **Plan:** [Xurgo Atlas Naming Migration Plan](./spec/docu-guard-mcp-v0.4-status-manifest-context.md#14-xurgo-atlas-naming-migration-plan-post-v04)
> These rows stay as historical planning context. They do not override the current Atlas-branded repository state summarized at the top of this document.

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Inventory legacy naming references | ✅ Complete | Identified package/lockfile, CLI text, MCP server metadata, `docs.*` namespace, generated templates, config/data defaults, event paths, docs, and tests |
| Define compatibility posture | ✅ Complete | Keep existing package/CLI/config/storage/MCP namespace behavior until implementation is separately approved |
| Plan package/internal rename phase | ✅ Complete | Package identity decision deferred; lockfile/import/bin risks documented |
| Plan CLI/server compatibility | ✅ Complete | Candidate new CLI alias can be introduced while retaining `docu-guard` for at least one transition period |
| Plan config/storage compatibility | ✅ Complete | Prefer non-destructive legacy discovery/aliasing before any explicit copy/move; rollback required |
| Plan MCP namespace compatibility | ✅ Complete | Keep `docs.*` initially; any future namespace requires aliases and deprecation docs |
| Plan test/validation scope | ✅ Complete | Future implementation must cover package metadata, CLI aliases, server metadata, storage migration, namespace stability, build/test/pack/runtime smoke checks |
| Implement rename changes | ⏳ Deferred | No runtime, package, CLI, config, storage, source-module, or MCP namespace rename is included in planning or readiness-audit tasks |

## Historical Naming Migration Readiness Audit

> **Status:** Historical implementation inventory; migration not started.
> **Inventory:** [Migration Implementation Readiness Inventory](./spec/docu-guard-mcp-v0.4-status-manifest-context.md#15-migration-implementation-readiness-inventory-phase-b-audit)
> Keep this section as historical scoping context rather than the current delivery headline.

| Area | Status | Implementation candidates | First-slice guidance |
|------|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Package metadata | ✅ Inventoried | `package.json` name/bin/description/keywords; `package-lock.json` root metadata | Additive bin alias is safe; package rename waits |
| CLI compatibility | ✅ Inventoried | `src/index.ts`, `src/cli/init.ts`, `src/cli/project.ts`, `src/cli/daemon.ts` | Keep `docu-guard` working; add `xurgo-atlas` only as an alias in first slice |
| Runtime/server naming | ✅ Inventoried | `src/mcp/create-server.ts`, daemon logs, startup text, help text, error hints | Display metadata can change separately from tool names |
| Config/storage compatibility | ✅ Inventoried | `src/core/storage.ts`, `src/core/registry.ts`, `src/core/project.ts`, storage tests | Exclude from first slice; requires legacy discovery/rollback plan |
| MCP namespace | ✅ Decision confirmed | `src/mcp/tools.ts`, resources, generated AGENTS.md, docs, tests, client prompts | Keep `docs.*` unchanged unless separately approved |
| Documentation references | ✅ Classified | Current-facing docs vs historical specs/changelog/compat notes | Brand current-facing docs carefully; preserve true legacy references |
| Recommended Phase B slice | ✅ Defined | Add `xurgo-atlas` bin alias while retaining `docu-guard`; focused tests and pack/build smoke | Do not include package rename, storage migration, namespace migration, or runtime feature work |
