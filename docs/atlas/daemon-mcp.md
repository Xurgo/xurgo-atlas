# Daemon, CLI & MCP Reference

## Install and Invocation Boundaries

Install Xurgo Atlas globally for the normal CLI path:

```bash
npm install -g xurgo-atlas
```

Other supported invocation paths are:

- `npx xurgo-atlas ...` for ad hoc use without a global install
- `npm install -D xurgo-atlas` for project-local automation
- this repository checkout plus a current local build when you are working on Atlas itself

The installed CLI entrypoint is `xurgo-atlas`.

- `xurgo-atlas -v` prints one `xurgo-atlas <version>` line and exits `0`.
- `xurgo-atlas --version` does the same.
- `xurgo-atlas --help` prints the top-level usage text and exits `0`.

If you are developing Atlas from this repo, prefer the checked-out source and local build here over a previously installed global copy. A running daemon or globally installed CLI may be version-skewed from your checkout.

Human-first setup guidance lives in [Setup](./setup.md). This file is the detailed CLI and MCP reference.

## Daemon Lifecycle and Project Binding

`xurgo-atlas daemon` manages the preferred Streamable HTTP MCP server:

```bash
# Start daemon in background
xurgo-atlas daemon start

# Stop daemon
xurgo-atlas daemon stop

# Check daemon status
xurgo-atlas daemon status

# Start daemon in foreground (for debugging)
xurgo-atlas daemon
```

The daemon runs on `http://127.0.0.1:3737` by default.

The registry may record multiple projects, but each running daemon instance is currently bound to one resolved project/root at a time. Startup resolves exactly one project from the current directory, `--project-root`, or an explicit registered `--project-id`; the background PID file records that bound project id and root. `daemon start` and `daemon status` should identify the bound project when that information is available.

If a daemon is already running for the same resolved project, `daemon start` reports the existing daemon and exits successfully. If a daemon is already running for a different project, startup fails instead of silently reusing the daemon. Stop the current daemon before starting another project:

```bash
xurgo-atlas daemon stop
xurgo-atlas daemon start --project-id <other-project>
```

The bound daemon should not silently serve another project through MCP. MCP requests without a project id may use the bound project, and MCP requests for the bound project continue to work. MCP requests that name a different project id should fail clearly.

## MCP Endpoint

The daemon exposes a Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint:

```text
POST http://127.0.0.1:3737/mcp
```

`GET /mcp` returning `404 Not Found` is expected and does not mean the daemon is broken.
`OPTIONS /mcp` is the CORS preflight path and may return `204 No Content`.
Raw `POST /mcp` requests should send compatible `Accept` headers that include `application/json` and `text/event-stream`, or the daemon may reply with `406 Not Acceptable`.
Prefer `xurgo-atlas daemon status` and actual MCP tool calls when verifying the daemon, rather than treating a browser `GET /mcp` check as authoritative.

Atlas is optional for Studio and other consumers. Use it when a client wants governed docs and Atlas project context through MCP; do not treat Atlas as a required dependency for every consumer.

## MCP Client Configuration

Run `xurgo-atlas mcp-config` for a human-readable setup summary.

Prefer `xurgo-atlas mcp-config --json` when configuring tools. The JSON output is the client setup payload and discovery boundary.

`xurgo-atlas mcp-config --json` does not modify project source files, Atlas-managed docs, or Git state. It may refresh local descriptive root-observation runtime metadata that Atlas uses for root/worktree reporting. It does not start or stop the daemon, and it does not require the daemon to be running.

The JSON output includes:

- stable server metadata (`serverName`, `displayName`)
- transport (`streamable-http`)
- MCP endpoint URL (`http://127.0.0.1:3737/mcp` by default)
- a suggested daemon start command
- `projectId` and `projectRoot` when the current project can be resolved
- Git identity fields under `git`
- the write-safety snapshot under `safety`
- descriptive root/worktree history under `rootLedger`

### opencode

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xurgo-atlas": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3737/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Other MCP Clients (HTTP)

Configure the endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:3737/mcp` with the Streamable HTTP transport.

### Stdio Mode (Local Development)

`xurgo-atlas server` remains the legacy stdio-oriented path. Prefer the daemon HTTP MCP endpoint for HTTP MCP clients. For direct stdio integration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xurgo-atlas": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/xurgo-atlas/dist/index.js", "server"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Project Identity and Write Safety

The `safety.safeForWrites` field is the client signal for mutating Atlas boundaries.

- `safeForWrites: true` means Atlas considers the current project folder binding safe for guarded write flows such as proposal commit, restore, and export.
- `safeForWrites: false` means clients should stay read-only and surface the mismatch or ambiguity to the operator instead of guessing.
- The other `safety` flags explain why writes are unsafe or ambiguous.
- `rootLedger` is descriptive context for coordinators and debugging. It does not override `safeForWrites`.

Connected clients can see the same safety concepts in `docs.status`, where they are reported under `rootContext`.

Current `xurgo-atlas` v0.2.1-era builds register `atlas.project_identity`, a compact read-only helper that reports the active project/root binding, marker and Git identity, write-safety status, descriptive root-ledger or recovery warnings, and the recommended next step. It does not replace `xurgo-atlas mcp-config --json`; use it after connecting when an MCP client needs a quick identity snapshot.

`atlas.project_identity.managedStateProvenance` is optional descriptive context for consumers that want extra managed-state provenance detail. Consumers should feature-detect it and tolerate its absence. It is not required for MCP discovery or ordinary Atlas operation, and it does not override `safeForWrites` for Atlas-managed write or export decisions.

## Live Capability Discovery

After a client connects, use normal MCP discovery and treat live `tools/list` from the connected server as the source of truth for the tools available from that running server.

Trust live `tools/list` over static docs, local source, or checked-out tests when they disagree. A running daemon may be stale or version-skewed from the source tree on disk.

Use `docs.capabilities` only as supplemental summary context. It is useful for broad read/search/write feature posture, but it is not the tool registry.

## Supported Tools

A current `xurgo-atlas` daemon should advertise its supported tools through live `tools/list`. In the current `v0.2.1` repository line, that public tool set includes:

### Discovery and read-only context

- `docs.list`
- `docs.read`
- `docs.read_section`
- `docs.status`
- `docs.manifest`
- `docs.context_pack`
- `docs.history`
- `docs.search`
- `docs.capabilities`
- `atlas.project_identity`

### Guarded branch and proposal workflow

- `docs.create_branch`
- `docs.propose_patch`
- `docs.propose_document`
- `docs.preview_diff`
- `docs.list_proposals`
- `docs.discard_proposal`
- `docs.commit_patch`
- `docs.restore_file`

### Export workflow

- `docs.preview_export`
- `docs.export`

## Read, Search, and Context Workflow

Use the read-only tools before proposing changes:

1. `docs.status` gives a compact project front page, current revision, export status, and project identity/safety context.
2. `docs.manifest` gives the project document map without reading every document body.
3. `docs.list` shows Atlas-owned managed docs and per-file revisions.
4. `docs.read` and `docs.read_section` load exact document content or one Markdown section.
5. `docs.context_pack` assembles a bounded orientation bundle from status, agent guidance, manifest, requested files, and requested sections.
6. `docs.search` searches Atlas-managed docs with local lexical search.
7. `docs.capabilities` summarizes read/search/write posture for clients.
8. `atlas.project_identity` provides a compact read-only identity and safety snapshot.

These tools read Atlas-managed documentation and context. They do not turn Atlas into a general semantic memory service.

## Contributor Managed-Doc Workflow

### 1. Classify the file before editing

Atlas-managed docs are the files returned by live `docs.manifest` and `docs.list`, including `STATUS.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `.docs-policy.yml`, `docs/manifest.yml`, and the active docs listed in that manifest. Treat Atlas as the only supported write path for those files.

Docs that are not returned by the live managed manifest are ordinary source files. Edit those directly in Git, but keep contributor guidance aligned with the current Atlas tool surface and do not describe roadmap-only behavior as current functionality.

If a document exists both on disk and in the managed branch, read the managed copy first. The working-tree file can be stale until `docs.export` reconciles it.

### 2. Follow the normal guarded lifecycle

1. Inspect the current project state with `docs.status` and `docs.manifest`, then read the target doc with `docs.read` or `docs.read_section`.
2. Create or select the intended managed branch with `docs.create_branch`. Matching the Git branch name is a useful convention, but Atlas managed branches are separate branch-scoped snapshots.
3. For an existing managed doc, call `docs.propose_patch` with the latest `baseRevision` from `docs.read`, an explicit `intent`, a concise `summary`, and a standard unified diff `patch` that uses `---` / `+++` headers and `@@` hunks. Atlas rejects `apply_patch` blocks, empty patches, and prose-only patch bodies.
4. For a new managed Markdown doc under approved Atlas paths, use `docs.propose_document` instead of editing the manifest or file directly.
5. Review the stored proposal with `docs.preview_diff`.
6. Apply it with `docs.commit_patch`.
7. Check `docs.status` or `docs.preview_export` for reconciliation state. If `exportRequired` or `workingTreeOutOfSync` is `true`, or `outOfSyncPaths` is non-empty, run `docs.export` before direct disk reads, Git commits, or merge preparation.

### 3. Stop when project identity or worktree safety is not clean

`docs.propose_patch`, `docs.propose_document`, `docs.create_branch`, `docs.commit_patch`, `docs.restore_file`, and `docs.export` are guarded write boundaries. If `docs.status.rootContext.safety.safeForWrites` or `xurgo-atlas mcp-config --json` reports `safeForWrites: false`, stop and stay read-only.

Use `rootContext` and `mcp-config --json` to inspect the resolved project root, Git worktree/common-dir, current branch, current `HEAD`, and mismatch flags. `rootLedger` and `rootContext.recovery` are descriptive coordinator context; they do not override `safeForWrites`.

`docs.discard_proposal` remains the cleanup path for stale uncommitted proposals and can still be used when the current root context is unsafe.

### 4. Use proposal history and direct-edit exceptions carefully

Use `docs.list_proposals` to inspect pending proposals by default, or broaden the query when you need committed or discarded records. Use `docs.discard_proposal` to retire uncommitted drafts by exact proposal id while preserving audit history; committed proposals stay protected from discard.

Do not direct-edit Atlas-managed docs on disk as a fallback. If a current policy explicitly permits an exception, cite that policy basis in review or handoff notes, explain why the guarded path could not be used, and reconcile the managed branch and working tree afterward instead of leaving the exception undocumented.

### 5. Keep Atlas-stored docs and source files separate

The Atlas-managed branch snapshot and the checked-out Git working tree are related but separate state surfaces. `docs.commit_patch` updates managed branch content; it does not refresh the source checkout by itself.

Treat `docs.preview_export` as the read-only reconciliation check and `docs.export` as the mutating boundary that writes the managed snapshot to disk. Before you commit or merge source changes, classify any drift as required branch work, valid managed-store/source synchronization, or unrelated stale drift to revert.

After a source branch is merged, later reconciliation between the merged source branch and the corresponding Atlas-managed branch may still be required. Do not assume a Git merge updates managed `main` automatically.

## Proposal and Export Lifecycle

Atlas proposals are audit records, not disposable scratch files. The normal lifecycle is `pending` -> `committed`, and uncommitted work can also end up in `stale`, `rejected`, or `discarded` states when validation changes or a draft is cleaned up.

Use `docs.list_proposals` to inspect active or historical proposal records. By default it returns pending proposals so stale internal drafts are easy to spot before they linger, and it can also be broadened to show committed or discarded records when you need a fuller audit view.

Use `docs.discard_proposal` when you need to retire a pending or otherwise uncommitted proposal by exact proposal id. The discard operation preserves the stored record, does not touch disk or the manifest for an uncommitted draft, and keeps committed proposals protected from discard by default.

After a proposal is committed, `docs.preview_export` shows what `docs.export` would add, modify, or overwrite on disk before any export write happens. The preview reports managed and source revisions when available, highlights drift and overwrite risk, and is especially helpful when the Atlas-stored docs or checked-out source branch may be stale.

`docs.preview_export` is read-only with respect to disk, managed document content, manifest state, proposal state, and working-tree files. Atlas may record best-effort internal recovery breadcrumbs for later status and preview reporting, but that breadcrumb write must not make the preview fail when the preview payload itself succeeds.

`docs.export` remains the mutating step that reconciles Atlas-managed branch content back to the working tree when the exported files need to be visible on disk. Export does not discard proposals or replace proposal cleanup.

Discarded proposals no longer appear in the default pending list, but they remain available in audit history and in broader `docs.list_proposals` queries.

## Security

- The daemon binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) by default.
- Do not expose the endpoint to untrusted networks.
- Do not bind to `0.0.0.0` without verified network-level protections.
- The daemon does not implement authentication; rely on network-layer controls.
