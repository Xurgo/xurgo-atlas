# Project Status

## Project
Xurgo Atlas is the project-context and documentation-safety MCP. The current implementation still uses transitional `docu-guard-mcp` package, CLI, and internal names.

## Current Focus
The v0.4 orientation workflow has been dogfooded. `docs.context_pack` works as the entry point, with `docs.status`, `docs.manifest`, bounded `docs.read`, and `docs.read_section` available for follow-up reads.

## Next Actions
- Add `compact` and `role` options to `docs.list`

## Blockers
- None currently

## Do Not Do
- Do not edit STATUS.md, manifest.yml, or .docs-policy.yml directly — always use docs.propose_patch
- Do not merge v0.2-daemon to main without resolving the branch-sync gap
- Do not rename package/CLI/repo mechanically — transition is gradual
